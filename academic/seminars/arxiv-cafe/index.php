<p>
  Ar&Chi;iv Caf&eacute; is a 1 hour meeting of (mostly) logicians in which everyone is encouraged to look at a paper that has been put on ar&Chi;iv this week (see <a href="https://arxiv.org/list/math.LO/recent">ar&Chi;iv.LO/recent</a>) and briefly present it to the other attendees.
    <br>
  Presentations typically last fewer than five minutes, but many go on to be longer and indeed there are no upper or lower bounds for your presentation.
</p>

<p>
  Meetings are weekly on Fridays at 15:00 in the MALL this term. See the email announcement to all-logic for details on how to join on Teams.
